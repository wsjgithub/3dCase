# Case for Photon 
###Considerate Driver Continued

The project is a case to enclose the photon and sensors from the previous projects. A light stripe that goes around the case shows the driving conditions:
Agressive driving - red
Normal driving - green

The case is made by utilizing a 3d printer and a laser cutter. The main body is printed; the light stripe is made of acrylic cut by laser cutter.
The case is composed of 4 layers:
From top to bottom:
1. a 3d printed lid that can be opened to place the photon and sensors.
2. 3d printed layer
3. laser cut arylic layer that functions as the light indicator. 
4. 3d printed bottom layer
Layers 2, 3, 4 are glued together. 

The case has an opening for the GPS which must face the sky and cannot be enclosed inside the case. 


A new LED strip is added as an output device.
